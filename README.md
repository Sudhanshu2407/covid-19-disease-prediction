# covid-19-disease-prediction
Here we use different parameter to predict whether the person is diagnosed with covid19 disease or not.

# Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly web application that can predict the likelihood of COVID-19 infection based on various 

symptoms and demographic features. The app serves as a preliminary diagnostic tool, helping users make informed decisions about seeking medical attention.


# üéØ Goals

Accurate Predictions: Provide reliable predictions using a trained machine learning model.

User-Friendly Interface: Ensure the app is intuitive and easy to use for individuals without technical expertise.

Educational: Offer essential tips and guidelines for users diagnosed with COVID-19 to promote health and safety.

Accessibility: Make the app accessible to a wide audience through a web-based platform.

# üåê Key Features and Benefits

Symptom-Based Prediction: Input symptoms such as cough, fever, sore throat, shortness of breath, headache, and demographic details like age, gender, and 

test indication.

Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to analyze input data and predict the likelihood of COVID-19 infection.

Text-to-Speech Integration: Leverages pyttsx3 to provide audible feedback, enhancing accessibility.

Guidelines and Tips: Provides crucial health tips and guidelines for users diagnosed with COVID-19, promoting better health practices.

Visual Appeal: Features an engaging UI with relevant imagery to enhance user experience.

# üíª Technologies Used

Streamlit: For creating an interactive web application.

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and processing.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

Pickle: For loading the pre-trained machine learning model.

Pillow: For image handling.

Pyttsx3: For text-to-speech functionality.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning model development.
